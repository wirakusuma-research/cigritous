## Branch Information

### Onboard Program Branch

*`main`*

Branch for drone computer programs. Contains drone *visual-inertial*, *pest detector*, and *precision landing* program

Hardware:

- NXP Vehicle Drone Kit (RDDRONE-FMUK66)
- NXP i.MX 8M Plus based 8M NavQ Plus Computer
- Google Coral 5MP Camera

Software:

- Linux Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Focal Fossa / 22.04 LTS Jammy Jellyfish
- ROS2 Foxy Fitzroy / Humble Hawksbill
- PX4-Autopilot v1.13.3

### Sensor Network / Ground Module Branch

*`ground-module`*

Branch for sensor network or ground module programs. Contains *sensor nodes* source codes and libraries.

The sensor network has 2 main part: **central** and **node**. The nodes are connected together by mesh and connected to sensors to sample ground data. Sampled data will be sent to central, which acts as 'back end' and communicating to onboard computer and FCU via TCP & MAVLink.

Hardware:

- Bosch Sensortec Environmental Gas Sensor BME688
- ESP32 DevKit
- YL-38/69 Moisture Sensor
- DHT22 Humidity and Temperature Sensor

Software:

- Arduino IDE 2.x or 1.x
- Libraries (contained in `libraries` folder):
  - painlessMesh
  - TaskScheduler
  - DHTesp
  - YL3869
  - MQUnifiedsensors
  - arduino-mqtt
  - Bosch BME68x library

#### Installation and Usage
[Read Me!](https://github.com/rotary-auav-ui/cigritous/blob/ground-module/README.md)  

### Web Server Branch

*`web_server`*

Branch for webserver front end. Acts as Web-based Ground Control Station which display agriculture and drone data from sensor network. *Tested in Heroku*.

#### Installation and Usage
